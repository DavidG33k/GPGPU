*
Let A and B be the matrices of double-precision floating-point numbers to be added,
and C the resulting matrix; Let m = 2^12 and n=2^16 be their number of rows and columns, respectively.
*
Implement four versions of the matrix addition application in CUDA using:
    - Standard-Memory/Monolithic-Kernels;
    - Standard-Memory/Grid-Stride-Loop-Kernels;
    - Unified-Memory/Monolithic-Kernels;
    - Unified-Memory/Grid-Stride-Loop-Kernels.
